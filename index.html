    <h1>Welcome to Renegade Minis</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Callie, aka Renegade Minis. I’m a Scottish artist making miniatures and tabletop games, usually of the skirmish variety.
    Most of the miniatures I make are customisable, multi-part kits, and can be used in the games I create or in other systems.
    I do sometimes choose to make more unique characters, vehicles, monsters, and have been known to make things like terrain, bases, tokens and more.</p>
    <p>If you're looking for something more custom for your collection, event, or game, I am available for commissions.
    <a href="/commissions/">Find out more about my commission work and how to get in touch.</a></p>
