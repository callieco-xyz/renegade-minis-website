Ang Gree is a very sneaky pirate captain designed for the 2025 Thrudball Charity Blood Bowl Tournament. How do you know he is sneaky? Well the shh gesture to the crowd obviously! Another great fun mini from the Thrudball team, and an opportunity to create something with a very different style than what we've made before. This miniature is being included in their tournament goody bags for all attendees.
