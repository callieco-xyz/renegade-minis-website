It's hard to overstate my excitement at getting a chance to work on a miniature as iconic as Thrud. For the 20th Anniversary of the Thrudball event Carl Critchlow created a special illustration depicting the titular bonehead indulging in a small half-time snack. This miniature was officially endorsed by Carl and I was delighted to even have a few chats with him to ensure the mini would meet his exacting standards.
