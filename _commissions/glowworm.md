I create custom miniatures that are inspired by the classics, designs that are as fun to paint as they are to display. My focus is on creating pieces that strike a perfect balance: detailed enough to feel special, but not so complicated that the joy of painting gets lost. Whether youâ€™re after something for your game, event, collection, or a unique character, I aim to craft miniatures that capture the charm of old-school designs, while being a pleasure to bring to life with paint.
