Steel Company is a brutal mech combat game where towering war machines clash in intense, close-quarters battles. Pilots engage in high-impact melee duels, smashing through armor with massive blades, hammers, and crushing fists while using grappling techniques and battlefield tactics to outmaneuver their foes. Every fight is a cinematic display of destruction, with sparks flying and metal crumpling under the sheer force of each blow. Between battles, players manage their company, repairing mechs, recruiting pilots, and making the tough decisions that shape their path through a war-torn world. Victory is not just about surviving the battlefield but building a force strong enough to endure the conflicts ahead.
