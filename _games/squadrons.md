Squadrons is a fast-paced game of high-speed aerial and space combat where pilots battle for supremacy in the skies or the void. Using fluid movement mechanics and dynamic positioning, players must outmaneuver their opponents, manage their speed and altitude, and unleash well-timed attacks to claim victory. Every dogfight is a test of skill, as pilots balance aggression with survival, exploit terrain or debris for cover, and react to ever-changing battle conditions. Whether commanding nimble interceptors, heavy bombers, or versatile fighters, only those with sharp reflexes and cunning tactics will dominate the battlefield.
