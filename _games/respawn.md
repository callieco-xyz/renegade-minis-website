Respawn is a tabletop team skirmish game, requiring only 3-6 miniatures of almost any kind per player, with influences from popular online team FPS games. Each team competes in Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill type missions, with characters respawning each round to continue the fight. A range of character classes, with weapon, equipment, and perk choices, let you create a unique team - using any style of miniatures you like.
