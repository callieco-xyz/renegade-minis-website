Ruckus Maximus is a chaotic and over-the-top gladiator brawl where goblins battle for glory, gold, and the amusement of a bloodthirsty crowd. Fighters enter the arena armed with unreliable weapons, wild tactics, and a complete disregard for self-preservation. Arena hazards, unpredictable events, and the cheers or jeers of the audience can turn the tide at any moment. Whether forming uneasy alliances, backstabbing rivals, or pulling off ridiculous stunts, every match is a spectacle of mayhem where only the cleverest, luckiest, or most reckless goblin will emerge victorious.
