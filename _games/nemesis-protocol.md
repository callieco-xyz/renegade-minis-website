Nemesis Protocol is a tense, horror-themed wargame of desperate survival and brutal conflict in the ruins of humanityâ€™s lost worlds. Players navigate a shifting, fog-of-war battlefield filled with locked doors, failing lights, and ever-growing threats. Three factions clash in the dark. Eradication Teams are tasked with containing the infection at all costs. Scavengers risk everything for forbidden knowledge and lost technology. The Infected are an evolving nightmare that spreads and adapts. With dynamic noise mechanics, escalating danger, and a constantly shifting battlefield, every mission is a race against time where stealth, strategy, and raw aggression are the keys to survival.
