    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>We take on a limited number of commissions each year, whether it’s a one-off sculpt or a full range, the goal is
    always the same: to bring your vision to life while staying true to the kind of minis we believe in.</p>
<p>Everything we make is designed with personality and made to be fun, if not always easy, to paint. We focus on strong
    clean designs, expressive details, and a style that nods to the hand-sculpted classics while still feeling fresh. If
    you’re after something with character, something that stands out on the table, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Interested in having something commissioned? Send an email to <strong>info<!-- -->&#64;<!-- -->renegademinis.com</strong>
    or reach out at any of our social media profiles and we’ll talk through your ideas.</p>

            <h3>Thrudball Anniversary</h3>

        <p>It’s hard to overstate my excitement at getting a chance to work on a miniature as iconic as Thrud. For the 20th Anniversary of the Thrudball event Carl Critchlow created a special illustration depicting the titular bonehead indulging in a small half-time snack. This miniature was officially endorsed by Carl and I was delighted to even have a few chats with him to ensure the mini would meet his exacting standards.</p>

        <p>Ang Gree is a very sneaky pirate captain designed for the 2025 Thrudball Charity Blood Bowl Tournament. How do you know he is sneaky? Well the shh gesture to the crowd obviously! Another great fun mini from the Thrudball team, and an opportunity to create something with a very different style than what we’ve made before. This miniature is being included in their tournament goody bags for all attendees.</p>

        <p>The first miniature we made for the Thrudball event celebrates one of their founding members who is clearly quite the character in real life. Trying to capture that character along with the chaos and fun of Blood Bowl was great fun. This was included in their 2024 event goody bags for event attendees.</p>

          <h3>About Renegade Minis</h3>
          <p>Renegade Minis is a Scottish based studio creating original tabletop games and awesome
              digital miniatures with character. Inspired by the charm of old-school wargames: bold sculpts, chaotic lore, and
              rules that left plenty of room for imagination.</p>
          <p>We’re combining that love of the old with fresh ideas, new mechanics, and a desire to make something that
              stands on its own. We build games that are fun to play, full of personality, and designed to spark creativity,
              whether you're here to collect minis, write your own stories, or throw yourself into a world of dice,
              rules, and mayhem.</p>
          <p><strong>This is what we love doing, and we’re just getting started.</strong></p>
