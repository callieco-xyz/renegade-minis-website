        <h2>Momentum Wargame System</h2>
        <p>Momentum is the core system behind our games, offering a common ruleset that makes it easy to pick up new
            games. It features a simple yet dynamic D6 mechanic and a flexible activation system that keeps battles
            strategic and engaging. Each game built on Momentum adds unique mechanics, factions, and scenarios, but the
            fundamentals remain the same, learn one, and the rest come naturally.</p>

        <p>The Broken Spur is a wide and wild frontier and you will find heroes, villains, and everything in-between

    </div>
    <p>We take on a limited number of commissions: from individual collectors and event organisers to studios looking to
        outsource miniature design. Whether it’s a one-off sculpt or a full range, the goal is always the same: bring
        your
        vision to life while staying true to the kind of minis we believe in.</p>
    <p>Everything we make is built with personality and made to be fun to paint. We focus on strong clean designs,
        expressive details, and a style that nods to the hand-sculpted classics while still feeling fresh. If you’re
        after
        something with character, something that stands out on the table, we’d love to hear from you.</p>

          <h3>About Renegade Minis</h3>
          <p>We are Renegade Minis, a two-person team based in Scotland creating original tabletop games and awesome
              digital
              miniatures with character. Inspired by the charm of old-school wargames: bold sculpts, chaotic lore, and
              rules that
              left plenty of room for imagination.</p>
          <p>We’re combining that love of the old with fresh ideas, new mechanics, and a desire to make something that
              stands on
              its own. We build games that are fun to play, full of personality, and designed to spark creativity,
              whether you're here to collect minis, write your own stories, or throw yourself into a world of dice,
              rules, and
              mayhem.</p>
          <p><strong>This is what we love doing, and we’re just getting started.</strong></p>
