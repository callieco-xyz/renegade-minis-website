    <p>We take on a limited number of commissions: from individual collectors and event organisers to studios looking to
        outsource miniature design. Whether it’s a one-off sculpt or a full range, the goal is always the same: bring
        your
        vision to life while staying true to the kind of minis we believe in.</p>
    <p>Everything we make is built with personality and made to be fun to paint. We focus on strong clean designs,
        expressive details, and a style that nods to the hand-sculpted classics while still feeling fresh. If you’re
        after
        something with character, something that stands out on the table, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
