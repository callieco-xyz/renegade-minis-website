      <h1>Momentum Wargame System</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Momentum is the core system behind our games, offering a common ruleset that makes it easy to pick up new games. It features a simple yet dynamic D6 mechanic and a flexible activation system that keeps battles strategic and engaging. Each game built on Momentum adds unique mechanics, factions, and scenarios, but the fundamentals remain the same, learn one, and the rest come naturally.</p>

<h2 id="coming-soon">Coming Soon</h2>

<p>The full Momentum Wargame System rules will be released soon and will be available online for free. You will also be able to support the development of our games by purchasing the pdf or physical rulebook.</p>

          <h3>About Renegade Minis</h3>
          <p>Renegade Minis is a Scottish based studio creating original tabletop games and awesome
              digital miniatures with character. Inspired by the charm of old-school wargames: bold sculpts, chaotic lore, and
              rules that left plenty of room for imagination.</p>
          <p>We’re combining that love of the old with fresh ideas, new mechanics, and a desire to make something that
              stands on its own. We build games that are fun to play, full of personality, and designed to spark creativity,
              whether you're here to collect minis, write your own stories, or throw yourself into a world of dice,
              rules, and mayhem.</p>
          <p><strong>This is what we love doing, and we’re just getting started.</strong></p>
