  <h2 id="welcome-newcomer">Welcome Newcomer</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the Broken Spur, a wild and untamed expanse along the edge of uncharted space. It is a lawless frontier that sits as a buffer between the complete unknown and the stifling rules of the Gilded Systems. Survival depends on your wits, fast reflexes, and sheer luck. The Spur is a place of opportunity and danger, home to ruthless outlaws, zealous vigilantes, roving bounty hunters, and daring adventurers all looking to carve their names into the stars.</p>

  <p>If you’re just looking for some honest work, I’d head to Ironclad, the planet is basically made of metal and there’s plenty to be done digging it up, refining it, and getting it off-world. If none of that interests you then they’re always looking to hire protection. There’s a serious pirate problem out there, turns out it’s a lot easier to let someone else dig up the gold if you can just take it from them afterwards.</p>

  <p>A little further out, you’ll find Brightfall, a lush planet with golden grasslands and sprawling mesas. But don’t be fooled by its idyllic appearance, Brightfall is as dangerous as it is beautiful, it’s teeming with all sorts of creatures that could swallow you whole or tear you clean in half. It takes a lot of grit to make it in a world like that but whatever you can keep your hands on is yours, free and clear.</p>

  <p>Maybe you want something a little more, let’s say “profitable”, I can put you in touch with some of the crews from Nox. I wouldn’t recommend finding your own way there, it’s deep inside a pretty volatile nebula that takes some care to navigate through. Plenty of work there if you don’t ask too many questions. You’ll need to prove yourself to those types though and I can’t help you with that.</p>

  <p>Well, if none of those suit you, then maybe head to Sundown Outpost. From there, you can book passage to a hundred other worlds and a hundred opportunities. Out here, you’ll find plenty of opportunity if you’re willing to get your hands a little dirty. Join a crew, earn some credits, and make a name for yourself.</p>

          <h3>About Renegade Minis</h3>
          <p>Renegade Minis is a Scottish based studio creating original tabletop games and awesome
              digital miniatures with character. Inspired by the charm of old-school wargames: bold sculpts, chaotic lore, and
              rules that left plenty of room for imagination.</p>
          <p>We’re combining that love of the old with fresh ideas, new mechanics, and a desire to make something that
              stands on its own. We build games that are fun to play, full of personality, and designed to spark creativity,
              whether you're here to collect minis, write your own stories, or throw yourself into a world of dice,
              rules, and mayhem.</p>
          <p><strong>This is what we love doing, and we’re just getting started.</strong></p>
