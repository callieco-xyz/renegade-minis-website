                <h2>Momentum</h2>
                <p>Momentum is the core system that powers all of my wargames, providing a shared ruleset that makes it easy to jump between ganes. It uses a simple yet dynamic D6-based mechanic, with a flexible activation system that keeps battles engaging and strategic. While each game built on Momentum adds its own unique mechanics, factions, and scenarios, they all share the same fundamental rules. Once you have learned one, picking up another is quick and intuitive.</p>
                <p>If you are new to my games, start here. Understanding Momentum will give you a head start in any of the wargames that use it, letting you focus on the action rather than relearning the basics every time.</p>

Survival depends on quick wits, fast reflexes, and an itchy trigger finger.

                <p><p>Nemesis Protocol is a tense, horror-themed wargame of desperate survival and brutal conflict in the ruins of humanityâ€™s lost worlds. Players navigate a shifting, fog-of-war battlefield filled with locked doors, failing lights, and ever-growing threats. Three factions clash in the dark. Eradication Teams are tasked with containing the infection at all costs. Scavengers risk everything for forbidden knowledge and lost technology. The Infected are an evolving nightmare that spreads and adapts. With dynamic noise mechanics, escalating danger, and a constantly shifting battlefield, every mission is a race against time where stealth, strategy, and raw aggression are the keys to survival.</p>

                <p><p>Respawn is a tabletop team skirmish game, requiring only 3-6 miniatures of almost any kind per player, with influences from popular online team FPS games. Each team competes in Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill type missions, with characters respawning each round to continue the fight. A range of character classes, with weapon, equipment, and perk choices, let you create a unique team - using any style of miniatures you like.</p>

                <p><p>Ruckus Maximus is a chaotic and over-the-top gladiator brawl where goblins battle for glory, gold, and the amusement of a bloodthirsty crowd. Fighters enter the arena armed with unreliable weapons, wild tactics, and a complete disregard for self-preservation. Arena hazards, unpredictable events, and the cheers or jeers of the audience can turn the tide at any moment. Whether forming uneasy alliances, backstabbing rivals, or pulling off ridiculous stunts, every match is a spectacle of mayhem where only the cleverest, luckiest, or most reckless goblin will emerge victorious.</p>

                <p><p>Squadrons is a fast-paced game of high-speed aerial and space combat where pilots battle for supremacy in the skies or the void. Using fluid movement mechanics and dynamic positioning, players must outmaneuver their opponents, manage their speed and altitude, and unleash well-timed attacks to claim victory. Every dogfight is a test of skill, as pilots balance aggression with survival, exploit terrain or debris for cover, and react to ever-changing battle conditions. Whether commanding nimble interceptors, heavy bombers, or versatile fighters, only those with sharp reflexes and cunning tactics will dominate the battlefield.</p>

                <p><p>Steel Company is a brutal mech combat game where towering war machines clash in intense, close-quarters battles. Pilots engage in high-impact melee duels, smashing through armor with massive blades, hammers, and crushing fists while using grappling techniques and battlefield tactics to outmaneuver their foes. Every fight is a cinematic display of destruction, with sparks flying and metal crumpling under the sheer force of each blow. Between battles, players manage their company, repairing mechs, recruiting pilots, and making the tough decisions that shape their path through a war-torn world. Victory is not just about surviving the battlefield but building a force strong enough to endure the conflicts ahead.</p>
