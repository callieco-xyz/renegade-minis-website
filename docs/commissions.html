    <div class="container">
      <p>We take on a limited number of commissions: from individual collectors and event organisers to studios looking to
    outsource miniature design. Whether it’s a one-off sculpt or a full range, the goal is always the same: bring your
    vision to life while staying true to the kind of minis we believe in.</p>
<p>Everything we make is built with personality and made to be fun to paint. We focus on strong clean designs,
    expressive details, and a style that nods to the hand-sculpted classics while still feeling fresh. If you’re after
    something with character, something that stands out on the table, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Commissions are just one part of the work we do, but we treat every project with the same passion and attention to
    detail. Together, we’ll create something amazing that fits perfectly into your world.</p>

<h4>Interested in having something commissioned?</h4>

    we’ll talk through your ideas.

        <p>Ang Gree is a very sneaky pirate captain designed for the 2025 Thrudball Charity Blood Bowl Tournament. How do you know he is sneaky? Well the shh gesture to the crowd obviously! Another great fun mini from the Thrudball team, and an opportunity to create something with a very different style than what we’ve made before. This miniature is being included in their tournament goody bags for all attendees.</p>

        <p>The first miniature we made for the Thrudball event celebrates one of their founding members who is clearly quite the character in real life. Trying to capture that character along with the chaos and fun of Blood Bowl was great fun. This was included in their 2024 event goody bags for event attendees.</p>

          <h3>About Renegade Minis</h3>
          <p>Renegade Minis is a Scottish based studio creating original tabletop games and awesome
              digital miniatures with character. Inspired by the charm of old-school wargames: bold sculpts, chaotic lore, and
              rules that left plenty of room for imagination.</p>
          <p>We’re combining that love of the old with fresh ideas, new mechanics, and a desire to make something that
              stands on its own. We build games that are fun to play, full of personality, and designed to spark creativity,
              whether you're here to collect minis, write your own stories, or throw yourself into a world of dice,
              rules, and mayhem.</p>
          <p><strong>This is what we love doing, and we’re just getting started.</strong></p>
