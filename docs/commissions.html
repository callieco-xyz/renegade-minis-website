      <p>I create custom miniatures that are inspired by the classics, retro designs that are as fun to paint as they are to
    display. My focus is on creating pieces that strike a perfect balance: detailed enough to feel special, but not so
    complicated that the joy of painting gets lost. Whether you're after something for your game, event, collection, or
    a unique character, I aim to craft miniatures that capture the charm of old-school designs, while being a pleasure
    to bring to life with paint.</p>
<p>Commissions are just one part of the work I do, but I treat every project with the same passion and attention to
    detail. Together, we’ll create something amazing that fits perfectly into your world.</p>
