        <h2>Momentum Wargame System</h2>
        <p>Momentum is the core system behind our games, offering a common ruleset that makes it easy to pick up new
            games. It features a simple yet dynamic D6 mechanic and a flexible activation system that keeps battles
            strategic and engaging. Each game built on Momentum adds unique mechanics, factions, and scenarios, but the
            fundamentals remain the same, learn one, and the rest come naturally.</p>
