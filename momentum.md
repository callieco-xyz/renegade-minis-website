title: Momentum Wargame System
permalink: /games/momentum/
---

Momentum is the core system behind our games, offering a common ruleset that makes it easy to pick up new games. It features a simple yet dynamic D6 mechanic and a flexible activation system that keeps battles strategic and engaging. Each game built on Momentum adds unique mechanics, factions, and scenarios, but the fundamentals remain the same, learn one, and the rest come naturally.

## Coming Soon

The full Momentum Wargame System rules will be released soon and will be available online for free. You will also be able to support the development of our games by purchasing the pdf or physical rulebook.
