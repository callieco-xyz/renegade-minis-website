title: Commissions

I create custom miniatures that are inspired by the classics, retro designs that are as fun to paint as they are to display. My focus is on creating pieces that strike a perfect balance: detailed enough to feel special, but not so complicated that the joy of painting gets lost. Whether you're after something for your game, event, collection, or a unique character, I aim to craft miniatures that capture the charm of old-school designs, while being a pleasure to bring to life with paint.

Interested in a commission? Let’s chat! Drop me an email at **callie at renegademinis.com** or reach out on BlueSky, @renegademinis.bsky.social, and we’ll talk through your ideas.

Commissions are just one part of the work I do, but I treat every project with the same passion and attention to detail. Together, we’ll create something amazing that fits perfectly into your world.
