<p>We take on a limited number of commissions: from individual collectors and event organisers to studios looking to
    outsource miniature design. Whether it’s a one-off sculpt or a full range, the goal is always the same: bring your
    vision to life while staying true to the kind of minis we believe in.</p>
<p>Everything we make is built with personality and made to be fun to paint. We focus on strong clean designs,
    expressive details, and a style that nods to the hand-sculpted classics while still feeling fresh. If you’re after
    something with character, something that stands out on the table, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Commissions are just one part of the work we do, but we treat every project with the same passion and attention to
    detail. Together, we’ll create something amazing that fits perfectly into your world.</p>
