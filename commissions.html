<p>We take on a limited number of commissions each year, whether it’s a one-off sculpt or a full range, the goal is
    always the same: to bring your vision to life while staying true to the kind of minis we believe in.</p>
<p>Everything we make is designed with personality and made to be fun, if not always easy, to paint. We focus on strong
    clean designs, expressive details, and a style that nods to the hand-sculpted classics while still feeling fresh. If
    you’re after something with character, something that stands out on the table, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Interested in having something commissioned? Send an email to <strong>info<!-- -->&#64;<!-- -->renegademinis.com</strong>
    or reach out at any of our social media profiles and we’ll talk through your ideas.</p>
