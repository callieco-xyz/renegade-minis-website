The joy of miniatures is what got me into this in the first place, and it’s what continues to drive everything I create. While I often make customisable, multi-part miniatures, sometimes I can’t resist crafting a character that’s just fun, something unique and full of personality. Whether it’s a modular piece or a single, striking character, my focus is always on creating miniatures that are a blast to paint, look great on the tabletop, and feel rewarding to work with.

Beyond miniatures, I also design all kinds of gaming essentials: bases, terrain, tokens, and more. Everything you need to make your games come to life. It’s all about creating pieces that add character and excitement to your collection, making your gaming experience even more memorable.
