Ang Gree is a very sneaky pirate captain designed for the 2025 Thrudball Charity Blood Bowl Tournament. How do you know he is sneaky? Well the shh gesture to the crowd obviously! Another great fun mini from the Thrudball team, and an opportunity to create something with a different style than what I'd made before. This miniature was included in their tournament goody bags in 2025.

This mini is also available on Cults3D, all proceeds for the sale of the model go to the Thrudball Charities, so you can grab one and do a little good at the same time. [Get Ang Gree on Cults](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/thrudball-2025-ang-gree-star-player-skeleton-secret-weapon).
