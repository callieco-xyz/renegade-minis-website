Renegade Minis is a Scottish based studio creating original tabletop games and awesome digital miniatures with character. Inspired by the charm of old-school wargames: bold sculpts, chaotic lore, and rules that left plenty of room for imagination.

We’re combining that love of the old with fresh ideas, new mechanics, and a desire to make something that stands on its own. We build games that are fun to play, full of personality, and designed to spark creativity, whether you're here to collect minis, write your own stories, or throw yourself into a world of dice, rules, and mayhem.
