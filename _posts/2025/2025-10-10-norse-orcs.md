Agema Minis approached me to sculpt an entire "Fantasy Football" team, an exciting challenge and one that gave me a chance to finally work on some Orc and Goblin models. This project grew in the making and I feel an immense sense of pride at the results. With 4 possible ways to run the team, and over 50 individual miniatures, it was an absolute blast to create.

These were released as physical minis on Kickstarter but should be available on [Agema Minis website](https://www.agemaminis.co.uk/) to purchase soon.
