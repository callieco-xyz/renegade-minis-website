# Renegade Minis

Hi, I’m Callie, aka Renegade Minis. I’m a Scottish artist making and self-publishing tabletop games. After spending decades enjoying wargaming and miniature painting, I decided it was time to make and share my own things. Here, you’ll find info about the miniatures and games I make, or you can follow me at [@renegademinis.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/renegademinis.bsky.social).

I focus on creating miniatures that are fun to paint and easy to enjoy, whether they’re retro-inspired designs or just a character that I couldn’t resist making. I’m all about keeping things simple, practical, and customisable when I can. I also design games using my custom Momentum game system, a solid foundation for straightforward, engaging experiences that I hope you'll enjoy.

If you're interested in commissions or want to chat about what I’m up to, drop me a message. I’m always up for talking about new ideas, getting feedback, or just talking about miniatures and games. Thanks for stopping by!
