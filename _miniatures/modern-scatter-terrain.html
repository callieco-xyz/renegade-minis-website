title: Modern Scatter Terrain
order: 20
---

<p>If you play anything in a modern setting, or as I was, a zombie apocalypse setting, you need a lot of scatter terrain
    to set the scene. A later scenario also had my survivors defending the remains of a hastily constructed military
    base which I designed to be modular for other kinds of games.</p>
