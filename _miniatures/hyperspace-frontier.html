title: Hyperspace Frontier - Multi-part 28mm Sci-fi Miniatures
order: 10
---

<p>After playing a little Stargrave I decided I wanted some more parts for kitbashing, kicking off my Hyperspace
    Frontier project. Each of these kits was designed to be as interchangeable with existing 28mm kits in scale and size
    of joints, or they can be built as a complete set on their own.</p>
